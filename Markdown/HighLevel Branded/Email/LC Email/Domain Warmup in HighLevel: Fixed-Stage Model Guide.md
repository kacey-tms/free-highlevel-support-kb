# **What is Domain Warmup?**

  
Domain warmup is the process of gradually increasing your daily email volume to build a trusted sender reputation with inbox providers like Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo.

  
Without proper warmup, new domains are more likely to:

  
* Be flagged as spam
* Experience high bounce or complaint rates
* Face email delivery blocks or delays

  
HighLevel automates this process to help you build trust and maximize email deliverability.

## **What Warmup Model Is Used?**

  
This system uses a fixed-stage, gradual warmup model, which means:  
  
* Each stage has a predefined daily sending limit
* Progression only occurs when the full daily limit for the current stage is reached
* If the daily limit is not met, the domain remains in the same stage
* There are no hourly sending limits
* You must send emails through the warming domain for progress to be tracked

  
**Important:** Sending beyond the daily limit is allowed and emails will not be blocked.

## **Warmup Stage Breakdown**

  
| Stage | Daily Limit |
| ----- | ----------- |
| 1     | 1,000       |
| 2     | 2,500       |
| 3     | 5,000       |
| 4     | 6,500       |
| 5     | 8,000       |
| 6     | 10,000      |
| 7     | 14,000      |
| 8     | 20,000      |
| 9     | 25,000      |
| 10    | 35,000      |
| 11    | 50,000      |
| 12    | 80,000      |
| 13    | 125,000     |
| 14    | 175,000     |
| 15    | 250,000     |

  
Once the daily limit is reached, the system pauses additional sending from that domain until 12:00 AM UTC the next day. The next stage will automatically begin if the full daily limit was reached.

## **When Does Warmup Start?**

  
* **For newly created domains:** Warmup is automatically enabled when the domain is created and verified. No manual action is needed.
* **For existing domains:** Warmup must be enabled manually. When you enable warmup on an existing domain, the system will automatically analyze:  
    
   * Past email activity  
   * Google Postmaster reputation data (if integrated)

  
Based on this, it will recommend the most suitable starting stage to ensure smooth warmup progression.

## **Google Postmaster Integration (Recommended)**

  
Integrating your domain with Google Postmaster Tools gives you access to key deliverability data, including:

  
* Domain reputation (High, Medium, Low, Bad)
* Spam complaint rates
* Authentication status
* Delivery and error metrics

  
If Google Postmaster is not yet connected or no data is available, the domain dashboard will notify you and guide you through setup.

---

## **Best Practices for a Successful Warmup**

  
* Send emails consistently every day
* Use verified, opt-in contact lists
* Avoid sudden spikes in volume
* Avoid switching sender domains mid-campaign
* Respect daily warmup limits to avoid future enforcement blocks

---

## **When Is Warmup Complete?**

  
Your domain completes warmup when it reaches Stage 15 (250,000 emails/day). At that point, you will see a "Warmup Complete" label in the domain dashboard, and full-scale sending will be supported.
