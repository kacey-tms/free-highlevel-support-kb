About: 

Store owners can now effortlessly import and sync their Products and Collections from Shopify to HighLevel (GHL). This enhancement enables store owners to migrate their entire Shopify store, including products, collections, contacts, orders, and transactions, into GHL. Additionally, Shopify store owners can leverage GHL’s marketing tools, including triggers like Order Submitted Trigger and Payment Received Trigger for better automation.

In the previous version of the Shopify integration, users could sync orders, contacts, and transactions from Shopify to HighLevel. The latest update expands this functionality, allowing store owners to seamlessly migrate and sync all their products and collections as well.

How to use:

1. Access the Integration:  
Shopify integration can be found within a sub-account at:  
Settings > Integration > Shopify  
.
2. Connect the Shopify Store:  
Users can click on "connect" button to begin the setup. A modal will appear where users must enter Admin API access Token and a valid Shopify store URL as the first step.
3. Select Data to Import:  
 In the second step, users will be directed to the Import Elements screen, where they can select which data to import from their Shopify store. The available options for import are:  
Contacts, Orders, Transactions, Products, Collections  
.
4. Configure Syncing Settings:  
 The third and final step takes users to the Sync Settings screen, where users can choose which data to continuously sync from Shopify to GHL in future. The options for syncing include:  
Contacts, Orders, Transactions, Order submitted trigger, Payment received trigger, Products, Collections  
.
5. Completing the Setup:  
 After selecting the desired elements to import and sync, click  
Save  
. The import and sync process may take some time to complete.
6. Manage Settings:  
Once the Shopify integration is successfully connected, users can enable or disable the elements they want to sync for future orders from the Shopify store.
7. Reimporting Data:  
 If users wish to reimport data, they can disconnect and reconnect the integration, allowing them to reimport any data they may have missed during the initial import.

Notes:

* Taxes are not mapped in Products while importing or syncing the Products.
* For each order, only one transaction is created in Highlevel.
* Order statuses are marked as "Completed" or "Cancelled" when synced with Shopify.
* Merged contacts in Shopify will have the primary contact updated in HighLevel.
* If there are no changes to the SEO details in Shopify (default SEO settings), the data will be received as null in HighLevel.

  
**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q1: Why aren't my contacts syncing from Shopify?**
Ans: Due to a Shopify API update, the Basic plan no longer provides access to customer PII (customer names, emails, addresses, phone numbers). This data is required to create Contacts in the platform.
Note: To sync contacts, you must upgrade to Shopify Advanced or Plus plan.
Reference: https://community.shopify.com/c/shopify-discussions/no-more-customer-pii-in-custom-app-integrations-for-shopify/m-p/2496209


**Q2: What Shopify data can sync on the Basic plan?**
Ans: On the Basic plan, you can still Import and sync:
- Products
- Collections
But you cannot sync:
- Contacts
- Orders
- Transactions


**Q3: It used to work before. Why did it stop now?**
Reference: https://community.shopify.com/c/shopify-discussions/no-more-customer-pii-in-custom-app-integrations-for-shopify/td-p/2496209
Admin APIs have these restrictions, and even the webhook calls that we receive have stopped returning the customer data
We previously used an older Shopify API that allowed PII access on all plans. That API is now deprecated. As we migrate to the new API, these restrictions will apply across the board.


**Q4: Where can I check or manage app permissions?**
Manage your Shopify app configuration here: [Shopify App Configuration](https://admin.shopify.com/store/1phxbv-b1/settings/apps/development/195355017217/configuration)


**Q5: Where can I find my Shopify Store name?**
If you don't know your Shopify store name, you can find it by logging into your Shopify account. Once you login to Shopify, you can find your store name by looking at the URL at the top of the page - your store name is the name or combination of letters and numbers to the right of "store/". In this example, the store name would be ef760-ef.
