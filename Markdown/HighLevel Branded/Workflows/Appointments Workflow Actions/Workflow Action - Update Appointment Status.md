## Overview

The "**Update Appointment Status**" action changes the status of an appointment associated with the contact in the workflow. This action can update an appointment to a new status, such as confirmed, cancelled, or showed. If the workflow was triggered by an appointment-related event (like "Appointment" or "Customer Book Appointment"), it will automatically update the status of the appointment that triggered the workflow. Otherwise, it will update the most recent appointment for that contact.

Consider a scenario where a customer cancels their appointment. This action can be used to automatically update the appointment status to "Cancelled." Alternatively, if a customer showed up for their scheduled appointment, the status can be updated to "Showed" to reflect that the appointment was attended.

## Additional Notes

* This action is useful for automating follow-up tasks based on appointment status changes.
* Ensure that the workflow is triggered by an appointment-related event to update the correct appointment.
* Always double-check the selected status before saving the workflow to avoid incorrect updates to the appointment status.
