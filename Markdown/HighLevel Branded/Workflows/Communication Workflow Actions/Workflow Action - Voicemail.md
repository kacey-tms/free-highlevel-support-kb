**How to Configure:**

1. **Name the Action:** Under "Action Name," ensure it reads "Voicemail" to identify the action being taken.
2. **Upload the File:** Click on the "Upload file" button to choose a pre-recorded voicemail message from your local system. Once uploaded, you can play the message to ensure it's the correct one.
3. **Save:** After configuring, ensure to save the workflow to apply these changes.

  
**Some Triggers (But not limited to)**

To use the Voicemail action effectively, consider combining it with the following triggers:

1. **Appointment No-Show:** If a contact misses a scheduled appointment, automatically send them a voicemail to reschedule.
2. **Follow-Up Reminder:** Trigger a voicemail if a contact hasn’t responded to previous communications within a set time frame.

##   

## Example

* **Trigger:** "Appointment Status Changes" changed to "No-Show"
* **Action:** "Voicemail"
* **Uploaded File:** "Reschedule.mp3" (a pre-recorded message encouraging the contact to reschedule their missed appointment)

In this example, the workflow will detect if a contact does not show up for an appointment and automatically send a voicemail to encourage them to reschedule, improving engagement without the need for manual follow-up.
